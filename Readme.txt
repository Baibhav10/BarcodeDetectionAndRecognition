Task1, task2, task3 and task4 must be run by assignment.py in order to obtain the desired outputs.
Example for running task4:

python assignment.py task4 ./data/task4 ./config.txt

If the user is testing the code from task4 -> task1, the user must paste the test images and text in the data/taskX folder every time they run each task as task4 will overwrite any pre-existing inputs. Hence, it is crucial for the user to replace the test folder to acquire the correct output. If the user is testing the code in the sequence task1-> task4, the user will not have to replace the test data.
